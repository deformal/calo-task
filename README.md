## Personal Notes

1. This was a fun task, from start to end, something I understood about the task, was that it was mostly to test my knowledge about async nature of NodeJS, and to see how I approach a project step from start to finish.
2. I have kept this project very simple as I believe this was the theme of the task itself.
